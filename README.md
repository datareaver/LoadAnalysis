LoadAnalysis
============

Four functions to determine the load that may be put on a system. Three of the functions perform the same calculations for different time intervals (days, hours, weekdays). LoadtoALOS utilizes a birth-death process where the state is the number of entities in the system. Average arrival and departure rates are calculated then used to determine the average time in each state.
